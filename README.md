## 🏅 Olympic History SQL Analysis — 120 Years of Insights
📌 Project Overview

This project explores 120 years of Olympic data using SQL-based analysis across two primary datasets — athletes and athlete_events. The goal is to derive meaningful insights such as medal trends, athlete performance, country dominance, and historical milestones. Rigorous data validation (missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent records) was performed before executing analytical SQL queries.

The project demonstrates strong SQL skills involving joins, aggregations, window functions, conditional grouping, and complex problem-solving.

## 🎯 Project Aim

Analyze historical Olympic data to uncover medal trends, top athletes, and country performance.

Use SQL queries to answer complex analytical questions.

Perform thorough data cleaning, validation, and consistency checks.

Build a structured and professional SQL analytics project.
